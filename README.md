# PPML
Projects work of Parallel Programming for Machine Learning

## PW1 Random Maze Solver
Implement three version of a random maze solver: 
A sequential version and two parallel version (OprnMP and Cuda)
Given a maze (dynamic maze) find the exit from that using the random
movement of a particle:
  - Start a large number of particles, move them
randomly bouncing on the walls
  - Backtrack the first particle to get out of the maze
to find the exit 


At the end it is necessary to evaluate a performance analysis (mainly the speed up)
### To build and run the project
Enter into the subdirectory PW1. 
$make
$./maze.x


## PW2 to be determined
